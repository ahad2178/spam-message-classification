# spam-message-classification
Spam messages are becoming highly common in different means of communication, including
email, text messaging, and social media. The objective of this project is to reduce and filter
undesired communication by using machine learning techniques to accurately classify messages
as spam or non-spam. We can improve user experiences and safeguard individuals and
businesses from spam-related hazards by building an effective spam message classifier.
